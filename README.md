#CHATTER BOX

Chat Web Application
* Client-Side React
* Server-Side Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO
* Sign in to Chat
* Select from list of active users to chat with
* Then "Get your Chatter on!!"
* All users and messages between users are saved in Local Storage

* To get this up and running you'll need to do the following:

    Create a virtual environment with virtualenv http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/

    Install all the python dependencies
      . venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt. (may need sudo)

    To run the web server you need to source your virtual environment (. venv/bin/activate)
      and execute "sh run.sh"

    Run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' (may need sudo) from the root directory if you would like to use gulp to edit any portion of the React code.
