                      <h3>Autism</h3>
                      <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a group of developmental
                        disorders. ASD includes a wide range, “a spectrum,” of symptoms, skills,
                        and levels of disability.</p>

                      <p>Some people are mildly impaired by their symptoms, while others are severely
                        disabled. Treatments and services can improve a person’s symptoms and ability
                        to function.</p>

                      <p>Parents or doctors may first identify ASD behaviors in infants and toddlers.
                        School staff may recognize these behaviors in older children. Not all people with
                        ASD will show all of these behaviors, but most will show several. There are two main
                        types of behaviors: “restricted / repetitive behaviors” and
                        “social communication / interaction behaviors.”</p>
