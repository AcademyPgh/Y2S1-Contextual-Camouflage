                      <p>Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain
                        disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and
                        the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.</p>

                      <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                      <p>There are four basic types of bipolar disorder; all of them involve clear
                        changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods
                        of extremely “up,” elated, and energized behavior (known as manic episodes)
                        to very sad, “down,” or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes).</p>

                      <p>The other day I told a friend that I did not want to speak with
                        them and the next minute i was in tears. It is so hard to maintain any
                        perspective on what matters.</p>
