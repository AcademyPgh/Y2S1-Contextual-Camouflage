                      <p>Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression)
                        is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms
                        that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such
                        as sleeping, eating, or working. </p>

                      <h3>Depression</h3>
                      <p>Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed
                        mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent
                        depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods
                        of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered
                        persistent depressive disorder.</p>

                      <h3>Depression</h3>
                      <p>Perinatal depression is much more serious than the “baby blues” (relatively mild
                        depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery)
                        that many women experience after giving birth. Women with perinatal depression experience
                        full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression).
