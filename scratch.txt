<button>GetSomeJson</button>

to do
-make sure HTTPS:// at all times so posts don't reroute to a screen
that can't do GET calls, look into flask-ssl and other things that might help
-db stores pins
-db queries to return json objects
-determine final Model
-get Heroku upgraded, maybe AWS too
-maybe login for moderator screen
-figure out what we can do on backend to ease D3 workload

for x in jl:
  pin = {}
