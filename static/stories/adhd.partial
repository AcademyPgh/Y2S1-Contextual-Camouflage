                      <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a brain disorder
                        marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity
                        that interferes with functioning or development.</p>

                      <p>Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity are the key behaviors of ADHD.
                        Some people with ADHD only have problems with one of the behaviors, while others
                        have both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Most children have the combined
                        type of ADHD.</p>

                      <p>My meds sometimes get off and it is hard to focus. I try really hard to pay
                        attention in class but I suddenly find myself talking while the teacher is talking
                        and I can not control it. Right now I am thinking about something else already. Thank
                        you for such a cool site. </p>

                      <p>For a long time, the doctors told me that it was all in my head but I knew it was real.
                        I finally found a good doctor and got help. Things have been better since but it is still hard.</p>
