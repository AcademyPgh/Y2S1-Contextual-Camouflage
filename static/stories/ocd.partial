                      <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic

                        reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that
                        he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.</p>

                      <p>This is such a great site. It could really use a site where people can express
                        their love for other people suffering though. And maybe a button for that kind of
                        thing.</p>

                      <p>Thank you for giving us a place to express how I feel. It really helps to write things
                        down and share them. That button is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen and whoever
                        set up the D3 is a genius. </p>
