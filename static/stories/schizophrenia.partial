                      <p>I have been hospitalized so many times that I have lost count. As a kid,
                        I used to tell people that I was at camp when I would have an episode. Things
                        are hard but I am doing better right now.</p>

                        having a lot of trouble. Just focusing is difficult but I am hanging on and trusting
